# splitfuns

This is a proof of concept of communicating information between different
modules using template Haskell. To show this off we implement a system that
allows users to define functions across multiple files. You can define a clause
in one file and another clause in another file and then combine them in a third
file.

In this package is split into two parts. The src directory contains the modules:

  * `Language.Haskell.TH.Module` - implements a system for sharing
      data between modules with template haskell.
  * `Splitfuns` - implements shows how that system can be used to
      allow users to define functions over multiple modules.
  * `Language.Haskell.TH.Serialize` - defines Serialize instances
      for template Haskell data types that make it possible to share template
      haskell types across modules.

The `app` directory showcases how the `Splitfuns` module can be used with a
simple example. It contains three modules:

  * `Main` - combines the base case with a recursive case of the
      factorial function and runs it.
  * `Base` - defines the base case of the factorial function
  * `Third` - defines the value `x` which is used in the base case

The `Third` module defines the value `x` which is used in the factorial
function, but that module is not imported in the `Main` module, so this shows
that missing modules are not a problem when combining the definitions.

This was developed to explore the design space of implementing the UUAG compiler
using template Haskell. Such an implementation should reduce friction for new
users and improve stability. Additionally it could allow us to use Haskell's
module system, which means that UUAG attribute grammars could be published to
Hackage and reused by other people.
